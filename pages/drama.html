			<h1>Drama Classes</h1>
			<h2>Junior Level</h2>
			<p>Junior level is structured to provide a gentle introduction into acting skills, walking through games, activities and storytelling. Freedom in movement and expression is the main aim of these classes. These are the foundation of good acting skills. It is a great way to spark a child's imagination and confidence. These drama classes are aimed at children between the ages of 6-10.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Intermediate Level</h2>
			<p>This level aims to introduce an understanding of acting as a craft, split into specific exercises set down to channel young actors into improvisation and scene building. These classes are aimed at students between the ages of 11-13.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Advanced Level</h2>
			<p>In this class, specific techniques are taught which give intrinsic structure to the actor's performance. They are challenging, rewarding and often regarded as "theatre's best kept secret". They aim to free up the student's creativity in order to work to professional standards. These techniques are used by some of the world's best actors. We feel privileged to teach these techniques, as they are not widely taught in the UK.</p>
