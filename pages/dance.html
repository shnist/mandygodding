			<h1>Dance Classes</h1>
			<p>
				We are able to teach an ever expanding array of disciplines within the school. We currently train pupils in ballet, tap, modern and jazz. All of our classes are taught by BBO &amp; ISTD qualified staff with many years experience. We educate pre-school children from as young as 2 and half years and our senior pupils generally stay with us until they are 18. Our school thrives to cater to every individual's need. Whether you are interested in dance for a fun hobby, exercise or you are looking to have a career in professional theatre, we can help.

			<h2>Pre-School</h2>
			<p>
				For the youngest children, pre-school classes start at the age of 2 and a half. We introduce basic ballet techniques alongside music mime and games aimed at building confidence and learning introductory skills. These include skipping and galloping within a relaxed class atmosphere.

			<h2>Primary School / Beginners</h2>
			<p>
				From the age of 4, classes are more structured towards ballet, tap or modern dance technique. Class discipline is introduced here, but we still maintain a relaxed learning environment, whilst trying to instil a joy of dance. Beginners are welcome at any age and will be recommended a class of appropriate age and standard.
			</p>

			<h2>Advanced</h2>
			<p>
				More advanced students have a wide range of classes in all genres. We cater for all: from those who dance simply for pleasure and exercise, to those aiming for a career in dance. In an effort to keep abreast of what is happening in dance on the professional circuit, we have introduced regular guest teachers currently working in the West End.
