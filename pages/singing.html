			<h1>Singing Lessons</h1>
			<h2>Individual Coaching Lessons</h2>
			<p>
				The voice is a muscle and like a dancer, a singing student needs to work through a series of bespoke exercises to facilitate adequate vocal development. We offer complete vocal coaching, working through correct posture, core centering, breathing, support, vocal placement and mixed register development.
			</p>
			<p>
				This training is available at all levels and experience, although it is specifically structured to meet the demands of current musical theatre repertoire.
			</p>
			<p>
				We pride ourselves on our knowledge of current theatrical trends and keep in close contact with Broadway and the West End. Sitting on audition panels in London for tertiary training, we are constantly aware of what is required in the business today.

			<h2>Harmony Singing</h2>
			<p>
				Harmony singing lessons are available once a week. These lessons give students the chance to work with other students in a harmony based class. The foundations of technique are also taught in this class and it is a great way to get a feel for vocal development as well as work through contemporary theatre and popular repertoire.
